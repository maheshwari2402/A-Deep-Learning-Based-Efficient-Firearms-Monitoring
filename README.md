In this , rigorous empirical results show how a deep learning-based framework can be used to find faces and guns. It has been seen that the WBF-based ensemble object detection scheme makes it easier to find faces and guns. But the FRCNN architecture makes a model file that is 108 MB in size, while EffDet-B0 only makes a 16 MB model file. So, using Efficient Det with different sized Efficient Nets as the backbone of the lightweight ensemble could be helpful. Again, FRCNN affects the FPS values in ensembles. It can be addressed by using a primary detection architecture with a faster frame rate. Even if the individual models are weak, their ensemble performs better due to the inherent diversity. The work can augment CCTV-based monitoring and transform it into an intelligent surveillance system. The prime aim of the work is to make society safer for our family and friends. 

               In the future, the work can be deployed for use in real time testing. There is scope for research on its reliability and scalability in the real world. This can also be combined with other violent and non-violent activities as well as detection of other weapons (such as knives, swords, etc.) to make a more robust intelligent surveillance mechanism. Thus, we can help society become safer.
